CRUD OPERATION USING SPRINGBOOT
Explain: 

I built a Student Management System using Spring Boot that focuses on complete CRUD operations — create, read, update, and delete student records.
I used Spring MVC for handling requests, Spring Data JPA with MySQL for database operations, and JSP with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for the frontend. 
Users can add new students through a form with validation, view all records in a table, update existing details, and delete records. 
I worked on both the backend logic and database integration, as well as designing the frontend pages. 
This project helped me understand Spring Boot’s MVC structure and how to implement CRUD operations end-to-end

Explain the CRUD Flow

Create:

“There’s a Student Form where the user can enter details like name, age, department, etc. On submission, the data is validated and stored in the MySQL database.”

Read:

“I created a View Students page where all student records are fetched from the database and displayed in a tabular format.”

Update:

“The user can select a student record to update. The existing details are pre-filled in the form, and changes can be saved back to the database.”

Delete:

“A delete button allows removing a student record, and the list updates instantly.”
